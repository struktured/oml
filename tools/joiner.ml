(*
 * This utility concats the test file (.mlt) at the end of the regular source
 * (.ml) file, modifying the source in the meantime. This should be used in
 * a copied build directory (such as if you're using OCamlbuild).
 *
 * We need to modify the files in place so that Bisect (used afterwards)
 * can easily detect which file (specifically filename) it is instrumenting,
 * as opposed to a random generated tempfile by camlp4.
 *
 * It is adapted from kaputt_pp.ml found in Kaputt, which performs a similar
 * processing. The associated license is included below.
