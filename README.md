A collection of OCaml Math and Statistics functions.
The API is available [online](http://hammerlab.github.io/oml/doc/index.html).

### Goals

  1. Perform simple and sophisticated mathematical and statistical analysis
      inside of (mostly) OCaml.
  2. Have a descriptive, simple, and typed approach to those algorithms.
      - _descriptive_: what a function does should be easy to understand from
        the type and name.
      - _simple_: don't worry about the corner cases of the alogrithms, until
        you have to.
      - __typed__: obviously.
  3. Well tested. There are a subtle dependency between `float` capabilities
     and these algorithms. The test suite aims to provide bounds as well as a
     benchmark for comparing algorithms.
  4. Informative examples.

### Building

  - `make` will compile source.
  - `make test` for tests.
        - We use [Kaputt](http://kaputt.x9c.fr/) as the testing framework. Tests
        are found in `*.mlt` files and are joined with their respective source
        files only when we build a test target.
        - `make TEST={ModuleName} test` will run the test in `ModuleName`,
           ex `make TEST=Descriptive test`
  - `make covered_test` for [Bisect_ppx](https://github.com/rleonid/bisect_ppx)
    instrumented test coverage.

### Dependencies

  `make setup` will `opam install` these:

  - [Lacaml](https://github.com/mmottl/lacaml) for BLAS/LAPACK bindings.
  - [LBFGS](https://github.com/Chris00/L-BFGS-ocaml) for bindings to LBFGS
      optimization routines.
  - [Kaputt](http://kaputt.x9c.fr/) for testing.
  - [Bisect_ppx](https://github.com/rleonid/bisect_ppx) for code coverage.
      - See [Bisect](http://bisect.x9c.fr/) for initial implementation
      - and [Ocveralls](https://github.com/sagotch/ocveralls/) for pushing to
          [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).
  - [ocephes](https://github.com/rleonid/ocephes) for special functions.

### Contributing

Anything within the problem domain is welcome.

#### Questions, Bugs, Issues

The best place to discuss Oml is within Github's
[issues](https://github.com/hammerlab/ketrew/issues) (even for questions).

#### Guideline

"Favor readers over writers" and _Favor users over readers_.
